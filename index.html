<strong>Jesus is King!!! John 3:16!</strong> 

<p style="color:rgb(253, 104, 104); background-color:beige; padding:1px">For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
<h1>Matthew 6:19</h1>

<p>Think about it, God loved the world (i.e. humans/us) that he sacrificed his Son. That whosoever should belive in his son and accept Him as their Lord and Savior shall have everlasting eternal life. That means they can live with Him in heaven forever</p>

<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where theives break through and steal.</p>

<p>Jesus loves you and wants a relatinship with you, he wants you to know him and what he's done for you. Give him a chance and take time to hear about him today.</p>
